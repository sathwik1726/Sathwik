	<b>Untill my 6th standard i studied in Kendriya Vidhyalaya school 
	then after i studied untill 8th standard in Keshava Reddy School 
	in my home towm Mahabubnagar.As my former school had been closed 
	i had to leave to Hyderabad leaving my mother and sister in my 
	home town.I joined Sri Chaitanya School in DD Colony Hyderabad as 
	it was not my home town i had to stay in a hostel.Even though that 
	hostel was not that it gave me lot of memories with friends and
	made me learn to adopt my self to different conditions.Then after 
	it was time for me to decide weather to continue my further studies
	there or shift to other collage for my intermediate.I decided to 
	stay in DD Colony itself and continue my intermediate there.Which
	was probably one of the most imporant decisions i have taken untill 
	then.Those two years of my intermediate was a combinatin of both joy
	and hard work which taught me many lessons about life and made me 
	stronger.After giving my JEE Mains and Advanced i joined IIT Roorkee
	for my under graduation.I opted for coumputer science engineering in 
	IIT Roorkee which i was intersted in.Its time for me to find my real 
	intrest and excel myself to the best.
